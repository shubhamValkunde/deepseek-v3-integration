A **Streamlit-based web application** that allows users to interact with documents using the **DeepSeek API**. Upload files (PDF, DOCX, TXT), ask questions, and receive answers based on the file's content. The app supports **streaming responses**, **context-aware answers**, and **customizable settings** like temperature and default prompts.
